DBMS Website

Pieces together data from Redis, SQLite, MongoDB, and Neo4j databases and shows it on a website.
routes.py queries each database to get the wanted information to populate the interactive HTML Jinja templates.
The website is hosted by the CPSC server at the University of Mary Washington and uses Flask to run.
